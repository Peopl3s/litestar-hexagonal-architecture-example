Hexagonal Architecture, also known as **Ports and Adapters Architecture**, was proposed by Alistair Cockburn as a design approach for building applications centered around a core of business logic that remains independent from external dependencies (such as databases, UIs, external APIs, etc.).

In this architecture, there are **no traditional "layers"** like in layered architectures (e.g., presentation → business → data). Instead, it revolves around an **application core**, surrounded by **ports and adapters**. However, for clarity, we can identify the following **logical components**:

#### 1. **Application Core (Hexagon)**

- Contains **pure business logic** (domain logic).
- **Has no dependencies** on external systems: databases, web frameworks, UIs, etc.
- Interacts with the outside world **exclusively through ports**.

#### 2. **Ports**

- These are **interfaces** defining **how the core communicates with the outside world**.
- There are two types:
    - **Primary (Driving) Ports** — used by **external systems to invoke the core** (e.g., REST APIs, CLI, UI).
    - **Secondary (Driven) Ports** — used by **the core to invoke external systems** (e.g., databases, external services).

#### 3. **Adapters**

- Concrete implementations of ports.
- **Bridge external technologies to the core** via corresponding ports.
- Also divided into:
    - **Primary Adapters** — invoke the core (e.g., Spring controllers, HTTP request handlers).
    - **Secondary Adapters** — are invoked by the core (e.g., repositories, external API clients).

#### Advantages:

- Easy testing (adapters can be replaced with mocks).
- Independence from frameworks and infrastructure.
- Flexibility: UIs, databases, or integration methods can be easily swapped.

#### Example:

- **Core**: Order processing service.
- **Primary Port**: `OrderService` (interface).
- **Primary Adapter**: REST controller calling `OrderService`.
- **Secondary Port**: `OrderRepository` (interface for persisting orders).
- **Secondary Adapter**: PostgreSQL-based implementation of `OrderRepository`.

Thus, in Hexagonal Architecture, traditional **"layers" are replaced by a "core + ports + adapters"** structure, ensuring architectural clarity and flexibility.
